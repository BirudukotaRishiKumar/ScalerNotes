Let us look at every bit’s position.

Every number that occurs twice will either contribute 2 ‘1’s or 2 ‘0’s to the position.

The number that occurs once-‘X’ will contribute exactly one 0 or 1 to the position depending on whether it has 0 or 1 in that position.

So:

If X has 1 in that position, we will have an odd number of 1s in that position.

If X has 0 in that position, we will have an odd number of 0s in that position.

Can you think of a solution using the above observation?
